⚙️ Project K.I.F. — The Kinetic Intelligence Framework

A kinetic AI discipline engine — where motion meets mastery.
Rei, the Business Samurai, translates discipline into data — training precision, focus, and execution through real-time cognitive flow. ⚔️🔥

⸻

🧠 Overview

Project K.I.F. introduces a new layer of AI-driven self-discipline architecture — a modular framework where kinetic performance and machine logic merge.
The system is designed to observe, adapt, and enhance user behavior through movement-based feedback loops, automating personal growth metrics and task alignment.

⸻
