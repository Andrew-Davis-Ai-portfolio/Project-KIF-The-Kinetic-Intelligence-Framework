### 🧠 Overview
**Project K.I.F.** (Kinetic Intelligence Framework) is a kinetic AI discipline engine — where motion meets mastery.  
It translates physical precision and mental focus into real-time, data-driven performance using **Rei**, the Business Samurai, as its adaptive training persona.

- 🔥 **Discipline through motion** — Every action becomes data.  
- ⚔️ **Cognitive feedback loop** — Learn, adapt, refine.  
- 🧩 **Modular AI architecture** — Compatible with OpenAI Assistants, local LLM nodes, and simulated training agents.  
- 🛰️ **Mobile-first execution** — Fully deployable from iPhone or field deck (M5 tier ready).

### 🏯 Command Structure – Rei Architecture Layers
**Rei, The Business Samurai**, is the first operational model within the Flame Division Kinetic Line.  
Each layer of the Rei framework corresponds to a discipline channel:

| Layer | Module | Function |
|:------|:--------|:----------|
| **Core Layer (Discipline Engine)** | Kinetic Loop | Converts physical actions into data feedback cycles for skill reinforcement. |
| **Cognitive Layer** | Intent Parser + LLM Interface | Reads operator intent and adapts execution paths via AI reasoning. |
| **Execution Layer** | Task Agent Manager | Deploys motion sequences and automates technical tasks (step-by-step instructor mode). |
| **Reflex Layer** | Auto-Calibration Protocol | Continuously optimizes model outputs based on human input speed, accuracy, and context. |

---

### 🧩 Integration Nodes
- **OpenAI Mode:** Connects to GPT-5 architecture for generative logic and data training.  
- **Local Mode:** Executes offline via mobile LLM or API relay.  
- **Hybrid Mode:** Merges OpenAI API and local AI for cross-sync execution and data preservation.
